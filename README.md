# database-qap2

GitHub Repository for Keyin College's QAP2 for Semester 3, Winter 2025.
Contains nothing more than two markdown files and this readme.

These two markdown files contain PostgreSQL queries for each problem outlined in QAP2, pertaining to the creation of tables and the searching, modifying, and deleting records of those tables.
